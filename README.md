### Use public data from OpenFoodFacts

The startup Pur Beurre works well knows French eating habits. Their restaurant, Ratatouille, is enjoying growing success and attracting more and more visitors to the Butte de Montmartre.

The team noticed that their users were keen on making a change in their diet but weren't sure where to start. Replace Nutella with a hazelnut paste, yes, but which one ? And in which store to buy it ? Their idea is therefore to create a program that would interact with the Open Food Facts database to retrieve the foods, compare them and offer the user a healthier substitute for the food they want.

### Specifications
#### Description of the user journey
The user is on the terminal. The latter displays the following choices:

1. What food do you want to replace ?
2. Find my substitute foods.

The user selects 1. The program asks the following questions to the user and the user selects the answers:

- Select the category [Several propositions associated with a number. The user enters the corresponding number and presses enter]
- Select the food. [Several propositions associated with a number. The user enters the number corresponding to the chosen food and presses enter]
- The program offers a substitute, its description, where to store or buy it (if applicable) and a link to the Open Food Facts page for that food.
- The user then has the possibility of saving the result in the database.
